## Description:

An application that generates a random password based on specified criteria and password length. This app runs off of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Starter HTML and CSS files were provided, in addition to an initial JavaScript file. However, the page was not interactive and the "Generate Password" button returned no results. Refer to the **starter-code** folder to view starter files.
